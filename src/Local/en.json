The 'Mass at the Sagrada Familia', an event organized by Sister Lucía Caram along with the Fundació del Convent de Santa Clara and businessman Enrique Tomás, featured performances by Pasión Vega, David Bisbal, and an esteemed choir and orchestra. The event brought together not only the local community but also generous souls from around the world in a historic charity concert for peace. The goal was to raise vital funds for the construction of a field hospital and to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war.\n\nThe event was blessed with the presence of Ukrainian doctors and soldiers, who, along with government officials and a multitude of faithful, gathered under the vaults of Gaudí's masterpiece. The support of Pope Francis was felt not only in words but also in the spirit that permeated the place. It was a night when music became a vehicle of unity, and Ariel Ramírez's 'Misa Criolla' resonated in the hearts of those present. This work, which transcends language and cultural barriers with its fusion of folk rhythms and liturgical texts, elevated the ceremony to a plane of moving spirituality.\n\nThe choice of 'Misa Criolla' for this occasion was no accident; Ramírez's work, with its deep roots in South American folklore and its universal message of peace and brotherhood, was the perfect complement for a night dedicated to solidarity with Ukraine. The fervent and passionate performance of the mass became a symbol of the resilience and hope of a people striving to build peace amid conflict.\n\nAs music filled every corner of the temple, donations flowed generously. The night's success was remarkable: significant funds were raised for the cause. This act of collective generosity demonstrated that the global community can unite and act as one to alleviate the suffering of those in greatest need. With the 'Mass at the Sagrada Familia', Barcelona became a beacon of hope, projecting a message of solidarity that will undoubtedly transcend time and continue to inspire acts of compassion and mutual support.",
