The 'Mass at the Sagrada Familia,' an event organized by Sister Lucía Caram together with the Santa Clara Convent Foundation and entrepreneur Enrique Tomás, featured performances by Pasión Vega, David Bisbal, and an honorable choir and orchestra. It brought together not only the local community but also generous souls from around the world in a historic benefit concert for Peace. The goal was none other than to raise vital funds for building a field hospital and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war. The event was blessed by the presence of Ukrainian doctors and soldiers, who, along with government officials and a multitude of faithful attendees, gathered under the vaults of Gaudí's masterpiece. The support of Pope Francis was felt not only in his words but also in the spirit that permeated the place. It was a night where music became a vehicle of unity, and Ariel Ramírez's 'Misa Criolla' resonated deeply in the hearts of those present. This masterpiece, which transcends language and cultural barriers with its blend of folk rhythms and liturgical texts, elevated the ceremony to a level of profound spirituality. The choice of the 'Misa Criolla' for this occasion was not accidental; Ramírez's work, deeply rooted in South American folklore and carrying a universal message of peace and brotherhood, was the perfect complement for a night dedicated to solidarity with Ukraine. The passionate and fervent performance of the mass became a symbol of the resilience and hope of a people striving to build peace amidst conflict. As the music filled every corner of the temple, donations poured in generously. The outcome of the night was a resounding success: significant funds were raised for the cause. This act of collective generosity showed that the global community can unite and act as one to alleviate the suffering of those in greatest need. With the 'Mass at the Sagrada Familia,' Barcelona became a beacon of hope, projecting a message of solidarity that will undoubtedly transcend time and continue to inspire acts of compassion and mutual support.",

It was organized as a birthday party for the children, with some celebrating their 'birthdays' and others their 'month-birthdays.' Wonderful volunteers organized various workshops, including face painting, soap bubbles, bracelet-making, and drawing. During the celebration, a special tribute was made with a sash and a gift for the mothers leaving the 'Estrena Vida' project, as their children had turned 2 years old. We enjoyed an international snack prepared by families who brought delicious traditional dishes from their countries. We would like to highlight the collaboration of the MartíDerm laboratory, which organized a skincare workshop led by dermatologist Dr. Montse Pérez, offering mothers useful tips to protect their children's skin and their own. All the children received gifts and left with colorful balloons that added more joy and fun to the event.",

  "estrenaVida-page-intro": "This is a project born in 2022/23 to address the need for many pregnant women to have basic clothing required by hospitals, as well as to provide a support network where they can share their concerns and questions about pregnancy or early childhood. The delivery of the baby basket is the first contact to later follow up and address other needs. We accompany these women during this stage of their lives to emphasize the value of motherhood and childcare. When the baby basket is delivered, the woman is provided with a space to express her concerns and doubts; she is offered the possibility of follow-up, and each woman decides whether to continue in the project or if she only needs that initial material support. The women in this project are referred by a social worker/educator who identifies the need and contacts us.",
